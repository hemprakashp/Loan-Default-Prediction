# Loan-Default-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict if a person will default on the loan based on the loan and personal information provided. The model is intended to be used as a reference tool by the financial institution to help make decisions on issuing loans, so that the risk can be lowered, and the profit can be maximized
